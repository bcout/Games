Huh.
Well, it seems a crisis has arisen out of nowhere.
This isn't good, but thanks to your tireless work we'll be able to feed all these people.
I'm still going to ask you to collect for us. No quota this time, collect whatever you want. The fact that we can feed everyone a meal despite the circumstances is a testament to your hard work.
Thank you again for your help. That's a long line out there, but we can handle it.
