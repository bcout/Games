$... Has anyone come in looking to help out?
No one.
$Seriously? I even managed to convince the city to put us on the front page. I thought that would work for sure.
I saw. Plus, my signs have been up all week. I can't explain it.
$Without help we will not be able to keep this food bank operational. We are both having trouble running this place as it is. We need someone to help collect food.
