Another productive day, I hope?
...
Wait a minute... There isn't enough here. You didn't meet the quota this time.
Oh, look at that. You got some hamburgers as well. Joy of joys.
But, since you met the quota yesterday, we have some extra food to go around. We won't need to serve these burgers. The 'healthy eating' program is on track!
Although, since you missed this quota we won't be ready should a crisis arise out of nowhere.
But what are the chances of that?! Ha ha ha!
Anyways, have a good one. See you tomorrow.
