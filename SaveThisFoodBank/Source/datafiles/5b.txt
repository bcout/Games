Let's see how you did this time.
*... Sigh... Missed the quota... What did I really expect?
Alright. I guess we'll have to ration again.
But hey! You avoided the hamburgers like I asked! You managed to do something right! Looks like that 'healthy eating' program is on the menu-
...
What meager menu this is...
Look, there's something I gotta tell you.
The support we'll generate through this 'healthy eating' program will be overshadowed by the fact that we're rationing two nights in a row.
We need volunteers who can help us keep this food bank running, and you just aren't that kind of volunteer.
Thanks for your help so far, but don't bother coming in tomorrow. We've recently found another worker we can call in.
The people of this city deserve someone who actually gets the job done.
