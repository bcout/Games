Another productive day, I hope?
...!
Yessiree! A productive day indeed! You met the quota and avoided all the hamburgers! I knew it was a good idea accepting your help.
And hey! More good news. Since you met both quotas, the food bank now has a buffer in case something bad should happen! We won't be in trouble if a crisis were to arise out of nowhere!
But what are the chances of that?! Ha ha ha!
Anyways, have a good one. See you tomorrow.
