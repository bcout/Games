Let's see how you did this time.
...!
Hey, hey, hey! You actually met the quota this time!
And look at that! No hamburgers!
This totally makes up for your blunder yesterday. The 'healthy eating' program is on track!
Thanks for your work today. We have enough food for tonight.
But, since you missed the first quota, we won't be ready should a crisis arise out of nowhere.
But what are the chances of that?! Ha ha ha!
Anyways, have a good one. See you tomorrow.
