$So, how is everything going?
We have it under control. The people are all receiving warm, healthy meals and it doesn't look like we'll run out of food anytime soon.
$Have you seen the volunteer anywhere?
I sent them home a few minutes ago. Don't worry, I thanked them profusely.
$I have no doubt, I just wanted to thank them personally.
$They did save this food bank, after all.
