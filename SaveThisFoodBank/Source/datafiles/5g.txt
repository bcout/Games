Another productive day, I hope?
...
So! You met the quota today as well! I knew it was a good idea accepting your help.
Oh, but you didn't avoid the hamburgers like I asked.
Good news, though. Since you met both quotas, we won't need to serve these hamburgers.
Also, the food bank now has a buffer in case something bad should happen! We won't be in trouble if a crisis were to arise out of nowhere!
But what are the chances of that?! Ha ha ha!
Anyways, have a good one. See you tomorrow.
