He's always so busy. I wish I could help more, but running a daily food bank is not a simple pass-time!
No matter, with your help things will definitely be more manageable.
So it's like I said: Collect enough food to replenish our stores. It is actually a rather simple job!
You see, for most people food is so abundant it practically falls from the sky! Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone.
We need you to go to where food falls from the sky and bring some back to us. Ok?
Head out the rightmost door to start collecting!
