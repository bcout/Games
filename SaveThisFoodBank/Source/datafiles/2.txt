Good morning!
Today is going to be different from yesterday.
You may have noticed, there is a longer line of people outside.
In order to meet the demand, I'm going to need you to meet a quota.
I need you to collect a certain number of each food item.
Your job remains essentially the same: Collect as much food as possible, but meet the quota before coming back inside.
I know you'll do great. Go out the rightmost door to get started.
