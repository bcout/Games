Start of day three! How do you feel? Fresh and ready to go, I hope!
Before you get started, I have some news. As you know, the public's support is what allows us to keep this gig running.
So, in order to generate more public approval, we've implemented a 'healthy eating' program.
I want you to avoid unhealthy food, like hamburgers, when you're collecting. Focus on healthy foods!
Alright! Feel free to get started. Also, don't forget the quota!
