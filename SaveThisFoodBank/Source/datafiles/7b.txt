$I just got off the phone with the mayor. He's seen the newspaper articles about this place and has decided to direct emergency funds our way.
Really? I mean, I'm thankful, but did it really take a crisis for him to realize how important this place is?
$I agree, it's disappointing, but at least we'll be able to feed everyone in need for the foreseeable future.
$Have you seen the volunteer anywhere? This help from the mayor would not have come without their help. I want to thank them personally.
I sent them home a few minutes ago. Don't worry, I thanked them profusely on your behalf.
$Well, I'm sure they know how much I appreciate them.
$They did save this food bank, after all.
