Huh.
Well, it seems a crisis has arisen out of nowhere.
... I don't know how to tell you this...
The food bank doesn't have enough food. You didn't collect enough. That line outside is MASSIVE, and our stores aren't full enough.
There's only one thing for it. I need you to go out, one last time.
This quota is bigger than the last two, but please try to complete it. If you can't I'll understand.
But please try. This crisis hit a lot of people. They are counting on you.
