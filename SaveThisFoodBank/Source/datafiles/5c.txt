Let's see how you did this time.
...!
Hey, hey, hey! You actually met the quota this time!
Oh, but you got some hamburgers as well. Joy of joys.
But, since you met the quota, we'll have enough healthy food to not need these burgers. The 'healthy eating' program is on track!
Thanks for your work today. We have enough food for tonight.
Unfortunately, since you missed the first quota, we won't be ready should a crisis arise out of nowhere.
But what are the chances of that?! Ha ha ha!
Anyways, have a good one. See you tomorrow!
