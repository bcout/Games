Let's see how you did this time.
*... Sigh... Missed the quota... What did I really expect?
Alright, I guess we'll just have to ration again.
Oh, look at that. You caught some hamburgers as well. Joy of joys.
Well, since we don't have enough healthy food, I guess we're serving burgers again tonight. So much for the 'healthy eating' program.
...
Listen, you know the situation we're in. Too many people, not enough food. We accepted your help because we thought you could get us more food.
Since that is clearly not the case, don't bother coming in tomorrow. We'll get someone else to help pull the load.
The people of this city deserve someone who actually gets the job done.
