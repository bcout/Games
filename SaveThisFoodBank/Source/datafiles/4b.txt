Oh, you again.
I hope you're bringing a bit more motivation in today, 'cuz thanks to you missing the quota yesterday, we need even more food today.
Oh, and before you get started, I have some news.
As you know, we need the public's support to keep this joint up and running.
Since we're not meeting quotas, we've found a new way to generate public support: A 'healthy eating' program.
From now on, I want you to avoid unhealthy food, like hamburgers, when you're collecting. Focus on healthy foods.
Got it? Avoid hamburgers and meet the quota.
I really need you to pull through this time, ok? Door's on the right.
